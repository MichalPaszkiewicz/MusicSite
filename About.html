<h2> The Chopin project </h2>
		
</p>My first and upmost project is to learn to play and record myself playing all of Chopin's works on guitar. Of course, this is no easy task, and I currently consider some pieces (if not many) absolutely impossible to play on guitar. In these cases I will make an exception and try to find someone to form a duet.<p>
</p>So if you know anyone else with a passion for Chopin that plays guitar to a very high standard, please oh please get them in touch with me!<p>


<h2> Personal compositions </h2>

<p>Aside from making arrangements of existing pieces, I spend most of the time I practice composing new pieces. Why? Because I find that if I want to learn a new technique, or strengthen an existing one, the best way to go about it is to increase your repetoire of music that utilises that technique. I believe the best way to do this is to write your own music utilising your new techniques.</p>
<p>Most of the pieces I write are, at the time of composition, just beyond my range of capabilities. Hence I may write a lot of pieces before I am comfortable performing them in anyone's presence. This is the best way to go about things, as my main aim in composing is to increase my own playing ability. This does not mean I never write easy pieces - only that my aim of improving happens to be the main driving force of my composing</p>
